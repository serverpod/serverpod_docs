# Upgrade from Mini to full

If you have started with Serverpod Mini, you can upgrade to the full Serverpod version anytime. Before you upgrade, it's good practice to back up your project, as some configuration files can be overwritten if you have manually created them.

To upgrade your project, change directory into your server, then run:

```bash
serverpod create .
```

Serverpod will now add the configuration files required for the full version.
