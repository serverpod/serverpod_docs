# Transactions

The essential point of a database transaction is that it bundles multiple steps into a single, all-or-nothing operation. The intermediate states between the steps are not visible to other concurrent transactions, and if some failure occurs that prevents the transaction from completing, then none of the steps affect the database at all.

Serverpod handles database transactions through the `session.db.transaction` method. The method takes a callback function that receives a transaction object. 

The transaction is committed when the callback function returns, and rolled back if an exception is thrown. Any return value of the callback function is returned by the `transaction` method.

Simply pass the transaction object to each database operation method to include them in the same atomic operation:

```dart
var result = await session.db.transaction((transaction) async {
  // Do some database queries here.
  await Company.db.insertRow(session, company, transaction: transaction);
  await Employee.db.insertRow(session, employee, transaction: transaction);

  // Optionally return a value.
  return true;
});
```

In the example we insert a company and an employee in the same transaction. If any of the operations fail, the entire transaction will be rolled back and no changes will be made to the database. If the transaction is successful, the return value will be `true`.

## Transaction isolation

The transaction isolation level can be configured when initiating a transaction. The isolation level determines how the transaction interacts with concurrent database operations. If no isolation level is supplied, the level is determined by the database engine.

:::info

At the time of writing, the default isolation level for the PostgreSQL database engine is `IsolationLevel.readCommitted`.

:::

To set the isolation level, configure the `isolationLevel` property of the `TransactionSettings` object:

```dart
await session.db.transaction(
  (transaction) async {
    await Company.db.insertRow(session, company, transaction: transaction);
    await Employee.db.insertRow(session, employee, transaction: transaction);
  },
  settings: TransactionSettings(isolationLevel: IsolationLevel.serializable),
);
```

In the example the isolation level is set to `IsolationLevel.serializable`.

The available isolation levels are:

| Isolation Level | Constant              | Description |
|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Read uncommitted | `IsolationLevel.readUncommitted` | Exhibits the same behavior as `IsolationLevel.readCommitted` in PostgresSQL |
| Read committed | `IsolationLevel.readCommitted` | Each statement in the transaction sees a snapshot of the database as of the beginning of that statement. |
| Repeatable read | `IsolationLevel.repeatableRead` | The transaction only observes rows committed before the first statement in the transaction was executed giving a consistent view of the database. If any conflicting writes among concurrent transactions occur, an exception is thrown. |
| Serializable | `IsolationLevel.serializable` | Gives the same guarantees as `IsolationLevel.repeatableRead` but also throws if read rows are updated by other transactions. |

For a detailed explanation of the different isolation levels, see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/transaction-iso.html).

## Savepoints

A savepoint is a special mark inside a transaction that allows all commands that are executed after it was established to be rolled back, restoring the transaction state to what it was at the time of the savepoint.

Read more about savepoints in the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-savepoint.html).

### Creating savepoints
To create a savepoint, call the `createSavepoint` method on the transaction object:

```dart
await session.db.transaction((transaction) async {
  await Company.db.insertRow(session, company, transaction: transaction);
  // Create savepoint
  var savepoint = await transaction.createSavepoint();
  await Employee.db.insertRow(session, employee, transaction: transaction);
});
```

In the example, we create a savepoint after inserting a company but before inserting the employee. This gives us the option to roll back to the savepoint and preserve the company insertion.

#### Rolling back to savepoints

Once a savepoint is created, you can roll back to it by calling the `rollback` method on the savepoint object:

```dart
await session.db.transaction((transaction) async {
  // Changes preserved in the database
  await Company.db.insertRow(session, company, transaction: transaction);
  
  // Create savepoint
  var savepoint = await transaction.createSavepoint();

  await Employee.db.insertRow(session, employee, transaction: transaction);
  // Changes rolled back 
  await savepoint.rollback();
});
```

In the example, we create a savepoint after inserting a company. We then insert an employee but invoke a rollback to our savepoint. This results in the database preserving the company but not the employee insertion.

#### Releasing savepoints

Savepoints can also be released, which means that the changes made after the savepoint are preserved in the transaction. Releasing a savepoint will also render any subsequent savepoints invalid.

To release a savepoint, call the `release` method on the savepoint object:

```dart
await session.db.transaction((transaction) async {
  // Create two savepoints
  var savepoint = await transaction.createSavepoint();
  var secondSavepoint = await transaction.createSavepoint();

  await Company.db.insertRow(session, company, transaction: transaction);
  await savepoint.release();
});
```

In the example, two savepoints are created. After the company is inserted the first savepoint is released, which renders the second savepoint invalid. If the second savepoint is used to rollback, an exception will be thrown.
