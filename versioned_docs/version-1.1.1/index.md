# Installing Serverpod
Serverpod is an open-source, scalable app server written in Dart for the Flutter community. Serverpod automatically generates your protocol and client-side code by analyzing your server. Calling a remote endpoint is as easy as making a local method call.

## Command line tools
Serverpod is tested on Mac and Linux. It works on Windows, but it's still experimental. Before you can install Serverpod, you need to have the following tools installed:
- __Flutter__ and __Dart__. You will need Flutter version 3.7 or later. https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
- __Docker__. Docker is used to manage Postgres and (optionally) Redis. https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

Once you have Flutter and Docker installed and configured, open up a terminal and install Serverpod by running:

```bash
dart pub global activate serverpod_cli
```

Now test the installation by running:

```bash
serverpod
```

If everything is correctly configured, the help for the `serverpod` command is now displayed.

## Serverpod Insights
Serverpod Insights is a companion app bundled with Serverpod. It allows you to access your server's logs and health metrics. Insights is currently in beta and available for Mac and Windows, but we will be adding support for Linux in the future.
