# Server events

Serverpod framework comes with a built-in event messaging system. This enables efficient message exchange within and across servers, making it ideal for scenarios where shared state is needed, such as coordinating streams or managing data across a server cluster.

The event message system is accessed on the `Session` object through the field `messages`.

## Quick Reference

Here is a quick reference to the key messaging methods:

| Method | Description |
|--------|---------|
| `postMessage`     | Send a message to a channel. |
| `addListener`     | Add a listener to a channel. |
| `removeListener`  | Remove a listener from a channel. |
| `createStream`    | Create a stream that listens to a channel. |
| `revokeAuthentication` | Revoke authentication tokens. |

## Sending messages

To send a message, you can use the `postMessage` method. The message is published to the specified channel and needs to be a Serverpod model.

```dart
var message = UserUpdate(); // Model that represents changes to user data.
session.messages.postMessage('user_updates', message);
```

In the example above, the message published on the `user_updates` channel. Any subscriber to this channel in the server will receive the message.

### Global messages

Serverpod uses Redis to pass messages between servers. To send a message to another server, enable Redis and then set the `global` parameter to `true` when posting a message.

```dart
var message = UserUpdate(); // Model that represents changes to user data.
session.messages.postMessage('user_updates', message, global: true);
```

In the example above, the message is published to the `user_updates` channel and will be received by all servers connected to the same Redis instance.

:::warning

If Redis is not enabled, sending global messages will throw an exception.

## Receiving messages

Receiving messages is just as simple as sending them! Serverpod provides two ways to handle incoming messages: by creating a stream that subscribes to a channel or by adding a listener to a channel.

### Creating a stream

To create a stream that subscribes to a channel, use the `createStream` method. The stream will emit a value whenever a message is posted to the channel.

```dart
var stream = session.messages.createStream('user_updates');
stream.listen((message) {
    print('Received message: $message');
})
```

In the above example, a stream is created that listens to the `user_updates` channel and processes incoming requests.

#### Stream lifecycle

The stream is automatically closed when the session is closed. If you want to close the stream manually, you simply cancel the stream subscription.

```dart
var stream = session.messages.createStream('user_updates');
var subscription = stream.listen((message) {
    print('Received message: $message');
});

subscription.cancel();
```

In the above example, the stream is first created and then canceled.

### Adding a listener

To add a listener to a channel, use the `addListener` method. The listener will be called whenever a message is posted to the channel.

```dart
session.messages.addListener('user_updates', (message) {
  print('Received message: $message');
});
```

In the above example, the listener will be called whenever a message is posted to the `user_updates` channel. The listener will be called regardless if a message is published globally by another server or internally by the same server.

#### Listener lifecycle

The listener is automatically removed when the session is closed. To manually remove a listener, use the `removeListener` method.

```dart
var myListenerCallback = (message) {
  print('Received message: $message');
};
// Register the listener
session.messages.addListener('user_updates', myListenerCallback);

// Remove the listener
session.messages.removeListener('user_updates', myListenerCallback);
```

In the above example, the listener is first added and then removed from the `user_updates` channel.

## Revoke authentication

The messaging interface also exposes a method for revoking authentication. For more details on handling revoked authentication, refer to the section on [handling revoked authentication](authentication/custom-overrides#Handling-revoked-authentication).
