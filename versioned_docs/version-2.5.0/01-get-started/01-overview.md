# Get started

The getting started guide will help you understand how a Serverpod project is structured, how to make calls to endpoints, and how to communicate with the database.

We also prepared a video going over the basics of Serverpod and the technology its built upon. If you want to jump right in, you can skip the video and go straight to the [Serverpod Mini](get-started-with-mini) section or [create a full Serverpod project](creating-project).
