# Serverpod Insights

Serverpod has a companion app. It is currently available for Mac and Windows, but Linux is coming soon. The app has support for viewing your server's logs and health metrics, but we are adding many more features in version 1.2. You must use a version of the app that matches the version of Serverpod you use in your project, or not all features may work correctly.
