# LSP server

The [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) is a standardized protocol designed to provide development environments with language-specific functionalities. In the context of Serverpod, the LSP server specifically offers diagnostics for YAML protocol files, aiding developers in identifying and resolving potential issues within these files.

To start the Serverpod LSP server, use the following command:

```bash
$ serverpod language-server
```
