# Build your first app

You will build a simple note-taking app in this tutorial. You will learn the fundamental building blocks of Serverpod that enable you to create powerful and scalable server-side applications with ease. 

We are assuming you have all the tools setup and ready to go. If not, please follow the [Installing Serverpod](/) guide to get up and running.

We will cover the following topics:

- Creating serializable objects
- Creating a database table
- Creating API endpoints for CRUD operations
- Using the serverpod code generator
- Using the generated client library
- Connecting a Flutter app to the server



Demo of what we will build: ([Full code example](https://github.com/serverpod/notes)).

## Create a new project

Create a new project using the Serverpod CLI. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ serverpod create notes
```

To start the server:

```bash
cd notes/notes_server
docker compose up --build --detach
dart bin/main.dart
```


## Serialize objects

Serverpod comes with a convenient way to create serializable objects with the help of code generation. These objects can easily be sent back and forth between the server and the client. This is managed by defining our objects in a YAML file which the code generator then parses and generates the necessary code for.

To define the structure of our Note object, we will create a YAML file called `note.yaml`. Navigate to the `lib/src/protocol` folder in your Serverpod project (`notes_server`). Create the file and add the following content:

```yaml
### Holds a note with a text written by the user.
class: Note
fields:
  ### The contents of the note.
  text: String
```

Let's take a closer look at the content of the `notes.yaml` file:
* **class: Note** Specifies the name of the class to be generated, which in this case is Note.
* **fields:** This keyword indicates the beginning of the field definitions for the Note class.
* **text: String** Defines the text field of type String in the Note class, in this minimal example we only have one field but you can add however many fields you need.


Use the code generator to generate the code for the `Note` class. Run the following command from the root of your server project:

```bash
$ serverpod generate
```

The code generator will process the `notes.yaml` file and generate the required code for the Note class.

After the code generation process is complete, you can access the generated code for the `Note` class. The generated code will be available in the `lib/src/generated/note.dart` inside your Serverpod project.

![Serverpod Insights](/img/tutorial/note-app/02-note-class.png)

By extending the `SerializableEntity` class, the `Note` object becomes capable of automatic serialization and deserialization by Serverpod. This means that the Note object can be converted into a serialized format and easily transmitted between the server and the client.

In simpler terms, we have created a class, `Note`, that can hold information and be passed around within the server. Additionally, we can send this object all the way to the client side of our application. Serverpod takes care of handling the conversion between the object and its serialized representation, making it convenient to work with and transfer data seamlessly.

## Create database tables

We will make use of Serverpod's built-in support for database integration. We can very easily create the bindings for the database for our new `Note` class by specifying the database table in the YAML file. 

The updated content of the `note.yaml` file should look like this:

```yaml
### Holds a note with a text written by the user.
class: Note
table: note
fields:
  ### The contents of the note.
  text: String
```

Run the code generator again to generate the necessary code for the database table:

```bash
$ serverpod generate
```

Take a look at the updated `lib/src/generated/note.dart` file. You will notice that the code generator has added a new methods for interacting with the database. 

### Access the generated SQL code

The code generator also generate the necessary SQL code for creating the database table. The SQL code can be found in the `notes_server/generated/tables.pgsql` file.

Here is the SQL code generated for the Note table:

```sql
--
-- Class Note as table note
--

CREATE TABLE "note" (
  "id" serial,
  "text" text NOT NULL
);

ALTER TABLE ONLY "note"
  ADD CONSTRAINT note_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id);
```

### Apply database changes

To apply the changes to the database, you need to execute the SQL code generated in the `notes_server/generated/tables.pgsql` file. You can use a database administration tool or the command line to run the SQL code.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="unix" label="MacOS & Linux" default>

```bash
docker compose run -T --rm postgres env PGPASSWORD="\$POSTGRES_PASSWORD" psql -h postgres -U postgres -d notes < generated/tables.pgsql
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```cmd
type .\generated\tables.pgsql | docker compose run -T postgres env PGPASSWORD="DB_PASSWORD" psql -h postgres -U postgres -d notes
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You need to replace `DB_PASSWORD` with the password for the database, you can find it inside the `notes_server/config/passwords.yaml` file.
If you didn't name your project `notes` you need to replace `-d notes` with the name of your project. 

Once the SQL code is executed successfully, the database table for storing the note data will be created.

:::info

Any time you update the table definitions you have to run the sql code on your database to update the database schema.

## Create API endpoints

In Serverpod, endpoints are defined in the `endpoints` folder within your server project. The code generator analyzes the code within these endpoints and generates a client library based on the defined functions. This client library makes it incredibly easy to access the backend functionality from your Flutter app.

Create a new file called `notes_endpoint.dart` inside `lib/src/endpoints` folder. 

```dart
import 'package:serverpod/server.dart';

import '../generated/protocol.dart';

class NotesEndpoint extends Endpoint {
  // Endpoint implementation goes here
}

```

In the above code, we import the necessary dependencies and import the generated `Note` class from the protocol.dart file. We also define the `NotesEndpoint` class, which extends the `Endpoint` class provided by Serverpod. This is required for the endpoint to be recognized by Serverpod's code generator.

### Define endpoints

To define an endpoint that can be called from the client, we need to create a method inside the `NotesEndpoint` class. This methods _must_ return a `Future` of a **serializable object**, **primitive datatype**, or **void**. 

The first method param has to be a `Session` object. This is a special object in Serverpod that contains information about the current session, as well as other convenience methods.

```dart
Future<void> example(Session session) async {
  // Endpoint implementation goes here
}
```

The method is also allowed to have any number of extra parameters. These parameters will be passed from the client when the endpoint is called. The parameters follow the same type restrictions as the return type.

### Store notes in the database

The `createNote` method creates a new note in the database. It takes a `Session` parameter and a `Note` parameter representing the new note to be created.

```dart
Future<void> createNote(Session session, Note note) async {
  await Note.insert(session, note);
}
```

In the above code, we use the `Note.insert` method to insert the specified Note object into the database.

### Delete notes from the database
The `deleteNote` method deletes an existing note from the database. It takes a `Session` parameter and a `Note` parameter representing the note to be deleted.

```dart
Future<void> deleteNote(Session session, Note note) async {
  await Note.deleteRow(session, note);
}
```

In the above code, we use the `Note.deleteRow` method to delete the specified Note object from the database.


### Fetch notes from the database

The `getAllNotes` method retrieves all the notes from the database and returns them as a list of `Note` objects. It takes a `Session` parameter, which represents the current session with the server.

```dart
Future<List<Note>> getAllNotes(Session session) async {
  // By ordering by the id column, we always get the notes in the same order
  // and not in the order they were updated.
  return await Note.find(
    session,
    orderBy: Note.t.id,
  );
}
```

In the above code, we use the `Note.find` method to retrieve all the notes from the database. By specifying `orderBy: Note.t.id`, we ensure that the notes are always returned in the same order based on the id column.

Putting it all together you end up with a file that looks like this:

```dart
import 'package:serverpod/server.dart';

import '../generated/protocol.dart';

class NotesEndpoint extends Endpoint {
  Future<List<Note>> getAllNotes(Session session) async {
    // By ordering by the id column, we always get the notes in the same order
    // and not in the order they were updated.
    return await Note.find(
      session,
      orderBy: Note.t.id,
    );
  }

  Future<void> createNote(Session session, Note note) async {
    await Note.insert(session, note);
  }

  Future<void> deleteNote(Session session, Note note) async {
    await Note.deleteRow(session, note);
  }
}
```

### Generate the client library

Congratulations! You have now created all the endpoints needed for the note app. Complete with a database integration that persistently stores the notes.

Let's run the code generator again to generate the client library for our endpoints (run from the server project).

```bash
$ serverpod generate
```

You can find all the newly generated code in the project folder `notes_client`. You normally don't need to touch this package, but it's good to know where it is located.


## Build the Flutter app

Open the `main.dart` file in your Flutter project.

Locate the `MyHomePageState` class.

Update the `MyHomePageState` class by removing all unnecessary code, so that it looks like this:

```dart
class MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(widget.title),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```

You can also remove the entire `_ResultDisplay` class from the file.

### Fetch the notes from the server

To fetch all the notes from the server and handle potential connection failures, we first need to declare variables to hold the state inside the `MyHomePageState` class.

```dart
import 'package:notes_client/notes_client.dart';
...

class MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {

  List<Note>? _notes;
  Exception? _connectionException;

  ...
}
```

Let's create a method to handle the connection failures. Call it `_connectionFailed`, it updates the state to set `_notes` to `null` and stores the thrown exception in `_connectionException`.

```dart
void _connectionFailed(dynamic exception) {
  setState(() {
    _notes = null;
    _connectionException = exception;
  });
}
```

Next, let's implement the fetching of notes from the server endpoint we implemented earlier. We set the notes state if successful otherwise we call the `_connectionFailed` method, to deal with the exception.

```dart
Future<void> _loadNotes() async {
  try {
    final notes = await client.notes.getAllNotes();
    setState(() {
      _notes = notes;
    });
  } catch (e) {
    _connectionFailed(e);
  }
}
```

Finally, we need to call the `_loadNotes` method when the app is initialized. We do this by overriding the `initState` method and calling `_loadNotes` from there. 

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  _loadNotes();
}
```

### Render the notes

To render the fetched notes in the app's main screen, we will update the build method inside the `MyHomePageState` class. Here is the modified code:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text(widget.title),
    ),
    body: _notes == null
      ? Container()
      : ListView.builder(
          itemCount: _notes!.length,
          itemBuilder: ((context, index) {
            return ListTile(
              title: Text(_notes![index].text),
            );
          }),
        ),
  );
}
```

The `_notes` variable is checked to determine if notes have been fetched from the server. If `_notes` is null, an empty Container widget is displayed as a placeholder.

If `_notes` is not null, a `ListView.builder` widget is used to render the notes. The `itemCount` property is set to the length of the `_notes` list, and the itemBuilder callback is responsible for building the individual `ListTile` widgets.

Inside the `itemBuilder` callback, each note's text is displayed in a `ListTile` using the `Text` widget.

### Create new notes

First, let's create a helper function to call our backend endpoint to create a new note. We call it `_createNote` and it takes a `Note` object as a parameter. 

```dart
Future<void> _createNote(Note note) async {
  try {
    await client.notes.createNote(note);
    await _loadNotes();
  } catch (e) {
    _connectionFailed(e);
  }
}
```

The `_createNote` method calls the `createNote` endpoint and then calls `_loadNotes` to refresh the notes list.

The user needs somewhere to input the notes, so let's create a dialog for this. To create the note dialog for entering the note's text, create a new file called `note_dialog.dart` and add the following code.

<details><summary>Code: note_dialog.dart</summary>
<p>

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void showNoteDialog({
  required BuildContext context,
  String text = '',
  required ValueChanged<String> onSaved,
}) {
  showDialog(
    context: context,
    builder: (context) => NoteDialog(
      text: text,
      onSaved: onSaved,
    ),
  );
}

class NoteDialog extends StatefulWidget {
  const NoteDialog({
    required this.text,
    required this.onSaved,
    super.key,
  });

  final String text;
  final ValueChanged<String> onSaved;

  @override
  NoteDialogState createState() => NoteDialogState();
}

class NoteDialogState extends State<NoteDialog> {
  final TextEditingController controller = TextEditingController();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    controller.text = widget.text;
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Dialog(
      child: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            Expanded(
              child: TextField(
                controller: controller,
                expands: true,
                maxLines: null,
                minLines: null,
                decoration: const InputDecoration(
                  border: InputBorder.none,
                  hintText: 'Write your note here...',
                ),
              ),
            ),
            const SizedBox(height: 16),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                widget.onSaved(controller.text);
                Navigator.of(context).pop();
              },
              child: const Text('Save'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

</p>
</details>

The dialog is needed but we will skip going into details on how it works as this is just normal Flutter code. The gist is that we have a function that triggers an input dialog and a callback for when the user saves the input.

We need a button to trigger this dialog and the floating action button is prefect for this. Add the following code to the build method inside the `MyHomePageState` class:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    ...
    floatingActionButton: _notes == null
      ? null
      : FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () {
            showNoteDialog(
              context: context,
              onSaved: (text) {
                var note = Note(
                  text: text,
                );
                _notes!.add(note);

                _createNote(note);
              },
            );
          },
          child: const Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
  );
}
```

We trigger the note dialog when the action button is pressed and then save the note in the `onSaved` callback. To make the UI feel more responsive we add the changes to the notes list before calling `_createNote`. This way the note will be added to the list immediately and then updated when the server responds.

Finally, add the loading screen to the project, create a new file called `loading_screen.dart` and add the code.

<details><summary>Code: loading_screen.dart</summary>
<p>

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class LoadingScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const LoadingScreen({
    this.exception,
    required this.onTryAgain,
    super.key,
  });

  final Exception? exception;
  final VoidCallback onTryAgain;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    if (exception != null) {
      return Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: onTryAgain,
          child: const Text('Try again'),
        ),
      );
    } else {
      return const Center(
        child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
      );
    }
  }
}

```

</p>
</details>

Replace the empty container with the loading screen in the `build` method.

<details><summary>Code: main.dart</summary>
<p>

```dart
import 'package:notes_client/notes_client.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:serverpod_flutter/serverpod_flutter.dart';

// anywhere in our app. The client is generated from your server code.
// The client is set up to connect to a Serverpod running on a local server on

  ..connectivityMonitor = FlutterConnectivityMonitor();

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Notes',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: const MyHomePage(title: 'Notes'),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyHomePage({Key? key, required this.title}) : super(key: key);

  final String title;

  @override
  MyHomePageState createState() => MyHomePageState();
}

class MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  // This field holds the list of notes that we've received from the server or
  // null if no notes have been received yet.
  List<Note>? _notes;

  // If the connection to the server fails, this field will hold the exception
  // that was thrown.
  Exception? _connectionException;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _loadNotes();
  }

  Future<void> _loadNotes() async {
    try {
      final notes = await client.notes.getAllNotes();
      setState(() {
        _notes = notes;
      });
    } catch (e) {
      _connectionFailed(e);
    }
  }

  Future<void> _createNote(Note note) async {
    try {
      await client.notes.createNote(note);
      await _loadNotes();
    } catch (e) {

    }
  }

  void _connectionFailed(dynamic exception) {
    // If the connection to the server fails, we clear the list of notes and
    // store the exception that was thrown. This will make the loading screen
    // appear and show a button to try again.

    // In a real app you would probably want to do more complete error handling.
    setState(() {
      _notes = null;
      _connectionException = exception;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(widget.title),
      ),
      body: _notes == null
          ? LoadingScreen(
              exception: _connectionException,
              onTryAgain: _loadNotes,
            )
          : ListView.builder(
              itemCount: _notes!.length,
              itemBuilder: ((context, index) {
                return ListTile(
                  title: Text(_notes![index].text),
                );
              }),
            ),
      floatingActionButton: _notes == null
          ? null
          : FloatingActionButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // When we tap the floating action button we want to show a
                // dialog where we can create a new note.
                showNoteDialog(
                  context: context,
                  onSaved: (text) {
                    var note = Note(
                      text: text,
                    );

                    // Add the note to the list of notes before we've received
                    // a response from the server which makes the UI feel more
                    // responsive.
                    _notes!.add(note);

                    // Actually create the note on the server.
                    _createNote(note);
                  },
                );
              },
              child: const Icon(Icons.add),
            ),
    );
  }
}
```

</p>
</details>


### Run the app

Start the database and server:
Make sure you reboot the server if you started it earlier.

```bash
cd notes_server
docker compose up --build --detach
dart bin/main.dart
```

Start the Flutter app in Chrome (or the platform of your choice):

```bash
cd notes_flutter -d chrome
flutter run
```

<ReactPlayer playing={true} loop controls width="960px" height="720px" url='/img/tutorial/note-app/03-note-create.mp4' />

### Delete notes

Implementing the delete functionality is very similar to the create functionality. We will add a delete button to each note and then call the delete endpoint when the button is pressed. First, let's add the helper method to call the endpoint:

```dart
Future<void> _deleteNote(Note note) async {
  try {
    await client.notes.deleteNote(note);
    await _loadNotes();
  } catch (e) {
    _connectionFailed(e);
  }
}
```

Next in our `ListTile` we add a delete button and call the `_deleteNote` method when the button is pressed. Just as before we update the local state first to make the UI feel more responsive.

```dart
ListTile(
  ...
  trailing: IconButton(
    icon: const Icon(Icons.delete),
    onPressed: () {
      var note = _notes![index];

      setState(() {
        _notes!.remove(note);
      });

      _deleteNote(note);
    },
  ),
),
```

We can now delete all the notes we have created.

<ReactPlayer playing={true} controls width="960px" height="720px" url='/img/tutorial/note-app/04-note-delete.mp4' />


### Edit notes

We leave this part as an exercise for the reader. Try to see if you can implement the edit functionality. You can use the `showNoteDialog` method we created earlier to show the dialog for editing the note. If you followed along so far you have all the tools you need to implement this feature!

Give it a go, in case you need some help you can look at the ([full code example](https://github.com/serverpod/notes)).

## Summary

In this tutorial, you learned how to build a simple note-taking app using the Serverpod backend framework. You started by setting up the necessary tools and the environment to work with Serverpod. Then, you covered various aspects of building the app, including creating serializable objects, creating a database table, and creating API endpoints for performing CRUD operations on notes.

You also learned how to use Serverpod's code generator and how to use the generated client library to connect the Flutter app to the server. By establishing this connection, you were able to fetch notes from the server and display them in the app.

Throughout the tutorial, you gained an understanding of how Serverpod simplifies the development process by automatically handling the serialization and deserialization of objects, managing database tables, and seamlessly integrating with Flutter. You have acquired the foundational knowledge to build powerful and scalable server-side applications using Serverpod.

Congratulations on completing this tutorial. You are now equipped with the skills to build your own server-side applications using Serverpod. Happy coding!
