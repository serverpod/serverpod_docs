# Where to go next

You should now have a basic understanding of how Serverpod works. The different topics are described in more detail in the _Concepts_ section of the documentation. If you are unfamiliar with server-side development, a good starting place for learning is to do the [Build your first app](../tutorials/first-app) tutorial. There are also many good video tutorials linked in the _Tutorials_ section.

If you get stuck, never be afraid to ask questions in our [community on Github](https://github.com/serverpod/serverpod/discussions). The Serverpod team is very active there, and many questions are also answered by other developers in the community.
