# Serverpod writing style guide

## 1. Write for technical, hands-on teams

Our audience is CTOs, lead developers, and Flutter teams building production apps. Write like a senior engineer talking to another senior engineer.

Rules:

- Be clear and direct.
- Avoid hype and vague claims.
- Be specific and concrete.
- Respect the reader’s intelligence.
- Acknowledge real technical tradeoffs without exaggerating.

Examples:

Weak: The ultimate backend solution for modern apps.\
Strong: Build your backend in Dart, deploy with zero configuration, and keep full control of your stack.

Weak: A powerful and robust platform.\
Strong: An open-source backend framework for Flutter teams who want full-stack type safety in Dart.

Weak: Managing infrastructure is a nightmare.\
Strong: Switching between Dart on the frontend and another language on the backend adds unnecessary cognitive load.

Weak: Supercharge your backend journey.\
Strong: Deploy your backend without touching a single config file.

## 2. Terminology and naming consistency

- Always capitalize **Serverpod** (proper noun).
- Always write **Serverpod Cloud** with both words capitalized.
- Always write the advocacy program as: **Serverpod Voyager - Developer Expert Program** (exact capitalization and hyphenation).
- Use consistent core terminology: prefer “backend framework” or “full-stack Dart framework” over mixing with “platform,” “solution,” or “BaaS,” unless context clearly requires it. Prefer “open-source backend framework” when emphasizing positioning, and avoid inventing new category terms.

### Canonical product phrases

Use these preferred terms consistently across the website, docs, and marketing:

- “Type-safe APIs” (not “typed APIs” or “strongly typed endpoints”).
- “Full-stack type safety” when referring to end-to-end Dart integration.
- “Zero-configuration deployments” when referring to Serverpod Cloud.
- “Streaming endpoints” for real-time functionality (not “real-time sockets” unless technically necessary).
- “Modules” or “built-in modules” are used when describing reusable functionality.
- “Open-source backend framework for Flutter” when positioning against alternatives.

Avoid introducing new labels for the same concepts unless there is a clear technical distinction.
